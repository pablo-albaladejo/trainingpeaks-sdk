 * Interfaces Layer - Entry Points

 * This layer contains the driven adapters (entry points) that receive

// HTTP Interfaces (if any)

// CLI Interfaces (if any)
// export * from './cli';

// Note: In this SDK, the main entry point is the TrainingPeaksClient
// which is located in the root and acts as a facade pattern.
// Traditional web applications would have controllers here.
