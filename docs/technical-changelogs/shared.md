# Shared Utilities Technical Changelog

This changelog tracks shared utilities and cross-cutting concerns. **Cross-cutting concerns** include logging, validation, error handling, request ID generation, session utilities, and other functionality that spans multiple architectural layers.

## [2024-08-10] - Initial Structure

### Added
- Created technical changelog for shared utilities and cross-cutting concerns
- Established format for documenting common utilities, types, and helper functions
- Centralized tracking approach for better visibility across the codebase

### Why
- Track evolution of shared utilities and their impact across layers
- Document cross-cutting concern decisions (logging, validation, error utilities, etc.)
- Provide context for utility function design and implementation

### Impact
- Better understanding of shared utility evolution
- Improved documentation of cross-layer dependencies
- Enhanced context for utility refactoring and optimization

### Trade-offs
- Additional documentation overhead for utility changes
- Centralized tracking approach chosen for better visibility across the codebase
